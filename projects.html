<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>My research interests includes PGAS Programming Models, massively parallel systems, parallel computation and compiler optimizations. At present, I'm working on OpenSHMEM and Coarray Fortran;</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Coarray Fortran</strong></p>
<p>Coarray Fortran (CAF), also sometimes referred to as Fortran Coarrays, is a set of new language features incorporated into the Fortran 2008 standard which enable parallel programming in Fortran with minimal changes to the language syntax. In this joint project between UH and Total S.A., we are investigating CAF as a viable programming model for production applications developed for HPC systems, with a focus on codes from the Oil and Gas industry. CAF contains considerable scope for compiler optimization to mitigate costs due to communication latency and synchronization. We have created an open-source CAF implementation within the OpenUH compiler and use this implementation to explore its performance potential.

<p><strong>OpenSHMEM</strong></p>
<p>
OpenSHMEM is a library-based parallel programming model that emphasizes an intuitive approach to distributed computation and communication by partitioning a global view of data. By leveraging network hardware capabilities such as remote direct memory access, OpenSHMEM implementations provide routines to transmit data, synchronize, and perform computations such as atomics and reductions, amongst distributed components of a program. The University of Houston is working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to standardize OpenSHMEM via a community-driven specification with a reference implementation and test-suite; promote its use via the web, conferences and workshops; and develop training and education materials.
