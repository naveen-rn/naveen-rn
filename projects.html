<h3>Publications</h3>
<p>Naveen Namashivayam, Sayan Ghosh, Dounia Khaldi, Deepak Eachempati, and Barbara Chapman. <b>"Native Mode-Based
Optimizations of Remote Memory Accesses in OpenSHMEM for Intel Xeon Phi"</b>. In <i>8th International Conference on Partitioned Global Address Space Programming Models (PGAS 2014)</i>, October, 2014, Eugene, Oregon, USA – Awarded with the Best Paper award</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p><b>Fortran Coarray – Open Source Contribution</b>(work in-progress)<br>
Created OpenSHMEM and UCCS communication layer support for Fortran Coarray library in OpenUH open source compiler. UCCS is a low-level communication substrate developed at Oak Ridge National Lab.</p>

<p><b>Performance Analysis for Intel Xeon Phi using hybrid models</b><br>
Performed analysis on Intel Xeon Phi co-processors using Stampede Supercomputer in Texas Advanced Computing
Center (TACC) to understand different performance tuning and optimizations for MPI, OpenMP and OpenSHMEM.</p>

<p><b>Compiler Intermediate Representation (IR) analysis</b><br>
Developed various iterative data flow analysis algorithms for analyzing Open64 compiler Intermediate Representation. The IR for Open64 compiler is called WHIRL (Winning Hierarchical Intermediate Representation Language).</p>

<p><b>OpenMP and Image Processing</b><br>
Parallelized the Optical Character Recognition application code for Vehicle Number plate analysis using OpenMP. Identified the hotspots in the OCR source code and parallelized those regions using OpenMP.</p>

<p><b>Software Design Pattern Implementation</b><br>
Implementing a number of software design patterns like Facade, Abstract Factory and Observer to provide solutions to various software design problems using Test Driven Development in Java with JUnit and Mockito as testing framework.</p>

<p><b>Amazon AWS</b>(work in-progress)<br>
Created and hosted a web based movie data analysis application with automatic caching, load balancing and application abstraction in AWS cloud service using EC2, DynamoDB and Elastic MapReduce.</p>

<p><b>Bigdata Analytics</b><br>
Various analysis and simulation were done on the US Flight data set using Hadoop modules like MapReduce, HDFS,
YARN and HBase</p>

<p><b>Parallelizing Algorithms</b><br>
Converted sequential versions of Image Smoothing, Jacobi, FFT and MD algorithms into parallel algorithms using OpenMP and OpenSHMEM.</p>
